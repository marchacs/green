  <h1 class=" text-center py-sm-5 text-dark"> Lazy Ways You Can Get a Green Bathroom</h1>
<p>Whether you realize it or not, you spend quite a bit of time in the bathroom!  One stat I found claims that men spend on average 2 years and 125 days of their lives in the bathroom and women spend 2 years and 40 days!<br/>

And, since you spend so much time in the bathroom, why not make it a green bathroom?  There are lots of lazy, low-effort opportunities!</p>

    <h2 class="text-success"> Recycle More for a Green Bathroom</h2>
        <p> Given the fact that you spend a lot of time in the bathroom you shouldn‚Äôt be surprised that you use a lot of products there.<br/>And, what do all of those product come in ‚Äì containers, packaging, etc.<br/>
        Shampoo is in a plastic bottle.  Toothpaste comes in a tube.  Toilet paper comes on a roll that is packaged in plastic wrap.  Razor blades come in a paper box.<br/>
        The examples go on and on.<br/>
        The first simple way to get a green bathrom is to buy products that either have less packaging or that are in packaging/containers that can be recycled‚Ä¶or better yet BOTH.  This way you can create less waste and send less to a landfill on the front end ‚Äì before you even use the product.<br/>
        This is called precycling.<br/>
        For example, you‚Äôre in the drugstore and need to grab some toothpaste.  You probably reach for a tube of toothpaste.  That‚Äôs going to leave you with a box you can recycle and a tube that you can‚Äôt.  <br/>
        Instead, grab a BOTTLE of toothpaste!  That‚Äôs going to leave you with a bottle to recycle and nothin‚Äô headed to the landfil!<br/>
        See?  So easy!<br/>
        Next is straight up, old-fashioned recycling!  Just. Do. More!</p>

        <ul><p>There are SO many things you can recycle from the bathroom.  Here are just a FEW but I bet if you go to your bathroom right now you can identify LOTS more:</p>

            <li>Shampoo/conditioner bottles</li>
            <li>Face/body lotion bottles</li>
            <li>Shaving cream cans</li>
            <li>Tampon boxes</li>
            <li>Toilet paper tubes</li>
            <li>Cotton swab box</li>
            <li>Hairspray bottle</li>
            <li> Paper backing of makeup packaging</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By the way, if you‚Äôre uncertain about whether you can recycle an item check to see if it has the ‚ÄúHow 2 Recycle‚Äù symbol on it.  And, check out my post, ‚ÄúDo You Know How 2 Recycle?‚Äù for more info about this handy symbol!

<h2>#1 Insulate Your Home</h2>
<p> The first energy saving tip for winter is to make sure your home is properly insulated. This can take the form of a bigger, possibly expensive project, or a quick, easy fix.<br/>

First, many utility companies offer a free home energy audit.  I think it‚Äôs worth it and something we did for our home.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>

Keep in mind there are likely to be a variety of recommendations that will cost you‚Ä¶but will probably pay for themselves in energy savings in the long run.   A quick call or website visit to your local electricity provider will likely provide some options available in your area.<br/>

The second, simpler option is to, on your own, make sure you take care of any drafty windows or doors.<br/>

For windows, make sure they are closed and locked securely which will keep them tightly sealed to keep cold air out.  When I did this I was surprised that on many windows the top sash had slipped down a bit leaving a crack at the very top of the window.  Pushing it back up allowed me to lock the window and create a draft-reducing seal.  Easy, right?<br/>

For doors, consider using simple draft blockers that you can pick up online or in retails stores.  They are easy to use and store once winter is over.  Many include loops on each end that you can use to hang when not in use ‚Äì or you can do what my family does ‚Äì just kick them to the side!  ü§£<br/>
I prefer a draft stopper that fits my decor AND is made with materials that are sustainably sourced.<br/>

Unfortunately finding an eco-friendly draft blocker proved to be a little challenging. However, I did, of course, find some DIY draft blocker tutorials on Pinterest!<br/>

This one from So Much Better With Age is adorable and uses dried beans as the filler.  Just use organic cotton fabric and you are good to go (in my book!).</p>

<h2> #2 Clean Your Filters</h2>
<p>
Next up on the energy saving tips for winter is to keep your furnace/AC filters clean! <br/>

A few years ago when our furnace stopped blowing warm air, I embarrassingly, called a repair person to come to take a look.<br/>

Fortunately, it was just a dirty air filter and easy to fix ‚Äì but I did get an ‚Äúeducation‚Äù about how important it is to make sure you have a clean filter. Oops!<br/>

Think about it, if the filter is dirty the system (heat or AC) has to work harder to maintain the temperature you set the thermostat to, so it‚Äôs running more often. And that means it‚Äôs using more energy!<br/>

So now that you (and I) will be keeping our filters clean to save energy (and money!!) you can go one step further and reduce the waste you create with disposable filters and switch to a reusable version.<br/>

I like these washable furnace filters and have 2 for each system so I‚Äôm always ready with a clean one when it‚Äôs time to take out the dirty one!  They come in a variety of sizes too!</p>

<h2>#3 Manage Your Thermostat </h2>
<p>
The #3 energy saving tip for winter is to efficiently regulate your indoor temperature is by having a plan for your thermostat. No more willy-nilly, random adjusting the temperature!  And, in my house, my teens are the worst culprits!<br/>

If you have a programmable thermostat, great!  If not, manually adjusting works too ‚Äì you just have to make sure you remember to do it!<br/>

If you are like me you may have had a programmable thermostat for a while but haven‚Äôt gotten around to actually programming it!  So, familiarize yourself with your thermostat.  If you have to, dig out or go online to find the user‚Äôs manual for your model.<br/>

We have this programmable thermostat which is really easy to use ‚Äì and affordable.<br/>

If and when we do replace our thermostat, I‚Äôd love to upgrade to a Nest thermostat.<br/>
</p>


<ul>
<p> When you do you program your thermostat (or set it manually), here is a general guide for winter settings for a family with adults and children that are out of the house all day for work and school:</p>

<li> 68¬∞F about 30 minutes before the family wakes up</li>
<li> 56¬∞F to 58¬∞F at the time the family typically leaves the house</li>
<li> 68¬∞F about 30 minutes before the family starts arriving at home</li>
<li> 56¬∞F to 58¬∞F once the whole family has gone to bed (and is bundled in warm pj‚Äôs and blankets!)</li>
<p> Try out these settings and see how they work for your family.  You may have to play a little with the timing and the exact                temperature but being aware of it is a good first step!</p>
    </ul>

<h2> #4 Use the Drapes & Blinds</h2>
<p> And the last energy saving tip for winter is to keep the drapes and shades on your south-facing windows open during the day to allow the sunlight to enter your home and provide some warmth.<br/>

Not sure which way is south?  Get your kids to help you figure it out!  Many smartphones either come with a compass or you can download a free app.<br/>

Make it your kids‚Äô task to make sure that the drapes on those windows are either open or closed each morning depending on what season you are in.  Easy, right!!?

So there you have it ‚Äì 4 easy steps to get you going on the right track to conserving energy and saving money this winter!
<br/>
Oh wait, I forgot the best one!  Get the whole family together for some snuggling on the couch in front of a fire ‚Äì fuzzy socks and cozy blankets required!  Enjoy!
